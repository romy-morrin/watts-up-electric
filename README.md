This is a website for Watts Up Electric, an electrical service based in Co Kildare, Ireland. The main objective of this website is to provide information for potential customers who need either household or commercial electrical services. The site consists of 4 main sections, a home section, a services section, an about section and a contact section.

## UX Design

### User Stories

#### Customer
As a potential client, I want to use a website that clearly shows me what services the company has to offer. I would also like to know some of the company’s history. I also want easy directions as to how to contact the company either by phone or email or by submitting a form. I want to see that this electrician covers the area that I live in. If I am looking for an electrical service in the Rep. of Ireland, I want to see that the electrician is registered with Safe Electric and that this is visible by the Safe Electric logo. 


#### Business Owner 

As a business owner, I want my website to clearly show the services I can provide to potential customers and my company’s history. I also want it to be easy for customers to contact my business either by phone or email or by submitting a form. I want it to be easy for customers to give me their location so that I can confirm whether it is possible to do work there. I want customers to see that I am a registered electrician with Safe Electric. 

### Strategy

When designing the website, my main objectivce was to keep the layout as simple as possible while providing all the necessary information. Completing the user stories was a great way to prioritise the content need to contruct the main sections of the site.

### Scope
When meeting with the business owner, we discussed what information was fundamental to the website. We discussed the services that needed to be listed, the informtation needed to give a brief history of the company and the best methods for potential customers to contact the company. I spoke with family members and friends who would be potential customers and what they thought would be necessary in an electricians website if they ever needed one. Most said that they would want an easy, accessible website that would show them the services provided and a simple way of getting in contact with the company. 

### Structure
Having this information, I was then able to structure the website in a way that prioritised the necessary information. It was clear that at least 3 sections were needed to display all of the information required.  It was established at this stage in the design process that the structure would have to be accessible, simple and coherent. 

### Skeleton

It is a one page scrolling website with 4 main sections:

* Home section
* Services section
* About section
* Contact section

My wireframes are slightly different from the live site. 

* Desktop
Firstly, I decided to use a jumbotron and center it in the middle of the home page. I altered the text here too and added a larger callout button. 
Also, I decided to place the form on the left hand side of the contact section as I was creating the site I realised that this is the most important part of this section. 

* Mobile
I thought the second image in the services section may looked too crammed on a mobile screen. I decided to keep it after completing this section as it did not look crammed. 

### Surface

#### Images

I used Adobe stock for the images used on the site. The business owner and I discussed what kind of hero image to use as a background for the home section. The business owner made it clear that they wanted an image that showed practicality (work tools) and one that had warm tones and colours. I looked around on websites for free images but unfortunately couldn't find any so I decided to use this one from Adobe. 

#### Colour

The grey tones of the background image in the home page are used across the site. I decided the match the jumbotron with the light grey color of the navigation menu. I picked a slightly darker grey color for the About section and matched the footer with this. The services section and contact section both have default white backgrounds as I believe this gives a nice contrast with the other grey backgrounds. The green used in the logo is replicated throughtout the site in the callout buttons which are in the home section and the services section. 

#### Typography

I used Google fonts "Quicksand" and paired it with "Roboto", however I decided not to use the "Roboto" font. I believe the "Quicksand" font matched the font of the logo and is easily readable while also adding a professional look to the overall site.
