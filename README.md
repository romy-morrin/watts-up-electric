## Description

![Mock ups for Website](https://github.com/romy-morrin/watts-up-electric/raw/master/wireframes/mockups.png/ "Mock Ups for Website")

This is a website for Watts Up Electric, an electrical service based in Co Kildare, Ireland. The main objective of this website is to provide information for potential customers who need either household or commercial electrical services. The site consists of 4 main sections, a home section, a services section, an about section and a contact section.

## UX Design

### User Stories

#### Customer
As a potential client, I want to use a website that clearly shows me what services the company has to offer. I would also like to know some of the company’s history. I also want easy directions as to how to contact the company either by phone or email or by submitting a form. I want to see that this electrician covers the area that I live in. If I am looking for an electrical service in the Rep. of Ireland, I want to see that the electrician is registered with Safe Electric and that this is visible by the Safe Electric logo. 


#### Business Owner 

As a business owner, I want my website to clearly show the services I can provide to potential customers and my company’s history. I also want it to be easy for customers to contact my business either by phone or email or by submitting a form. I want it to be easy for customers to give me their location so that I can confirm whether it is possible to do work there. I want customers to see that I am a registered electrician with Safe Electric. 

### Strategy

When designing the website, my main objectivce was to keep the layout as simple as possible while providing all the necessary information. Completing the user stories was a great way to prioritise the content need to contruct the main sections of the site.

### Scope
When meeting with the business owner, we discussed what information was fundamental to the website and what design layout would best suit the structure of the website. We discussed the services that needed to be listed, the informtation needed to give a brief history of the company and the best methods for potential customers to contact the company. I spoke with family members and friends who would be potential customers and what they thought would be necessary in an electricians website if they ever needed one. Most said that they would want an easy, accessible website that would show them the services provided and a simple way of getting in contact with the company.
